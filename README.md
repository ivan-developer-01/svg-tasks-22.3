# svg-tasks-22.3

This repository contains tasks from lesson 22.3 to learn SVG.

There are two tasks. They are stored in the subfolders `task-1` and `task-2`.

## Task descriptions

1. > Use *SVG* elements to depict the flags of five countries: Russia, France, Finland, Switzerland, Japan.
   >
   > Each flag *SVG* element must be 180 by 120 pixels.
2. > Create a button that will contain [icon_01](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/arrow-down-left-circle/) (as in the example in the last video). When you click on the button, the icon should change to [icon_02](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/arrow-down-left-circle-fill/). Clicking again changes the icon back.

You can see it live on [GitHub Pages website](https://ivan-developer-01.github.io/svg-tasks-22.3).
